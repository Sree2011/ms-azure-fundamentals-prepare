	<p><strong>1. When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The information and data stored in the cloud</li>
		<li>Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)</li>
		<li>The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>2. The cloud provider is always responsible for:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The physical datacenter</li>
		<li>The physical network</li>
		<li>The physical hosts</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>3. Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Operating systems</li>
		<li>Network controls</li>
		<li>Applications</li>
		<li>Identity and infrastructure</li>

            [Flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand.]

        (Spot Pricing)
            [Bid on unused cloud resources at a lower price.]
            [Suitable for non-critical workloads or batch processing.]
            [Availability depends on resource availability and demand.]

        (Reserved Instances)
            [Commit to using specific resources for a fixed term of 1-3 years.]
