	<p><strong>1. When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The information and data stored in the cloud</li>
		<li>Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)</li>
		<li>The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>2. The cloud provider is always responsible for:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The physical datacenter</li>
		<li>The physical network</li>
		<li>The physical hosts</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>3. Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Operating systems</li>
		<li>Network controls</li>
		<li>Applications</li>
		<li>Identity and infrastructure</li>

	<h2 id="availability">High Availability and Scalability</h2>
	<h3>High availability:</h3>
	<p>Long run, low downtime</p>
	<h3>Scalability:</h3>
	<p>The ability to increase or decrease resources on-demand</p>

	<h3>Vertical Scaling:</h3>
	<p>With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed
		more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs
		or RAM to the virtual machine.
		Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs,
		you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.
	</p>


	<h2 id="agility">Elasticity and Agility</h2>
	<h3>Elasticity:</h3>
	<p>The ability to scale up and down dynamically.</p>

	<h3>Agility:</h3>
	<p>The ability to allocate and de-allocate resources on-demand.</p>

	<h2>Reliability and Predictability:</h2>
	<h3>Reliability:</h3>

	<h3>Horizontal Scaling:</h3>
	<p>
		With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump
		in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either
		automatically or manually). For example, you could add additional
		virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner,
		if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could
		be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.
