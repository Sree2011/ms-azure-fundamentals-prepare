## II. SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL

1. When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

   - The information and data stored in the cloud
   - Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
   - The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

2. The cloud provider is always responsible for:

   - The physical datacenter
   - The physical network
   - The physical hosts

3. Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

   - Operating systems
